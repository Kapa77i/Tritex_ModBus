# Tritex_ModBus

Thesis project of controlling Tritex Actuators with the help of Tritex Expert Software. This is a prototype code to showcase remote connection to the actuators and being able to send commands via Modbus TCP/IP Protocol.

Build uses FluentModbuss nugget. 

<b>Current code withholds:</b>
- Connection to actuators
- Enable maintained inputs
- Jog +/- inputs
- Home input
- Stop Input
- Move 1 input (not working atm)

There is also hidden server code/form to debug whenever you cannot access the simulator to test out simple read/write commands.
